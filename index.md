Welcome to BOTY Development Page. This is our Github page to provide an insight about the people behind the sucess of BestoftheYear - Your Favourite Music and Movies website.

## About BOTY 
The whole Idea of [BestoftheYear.in](https://bestoftheyear.in/) website is centered around movies. Later on as the demand for movies grew, so did music. But we wanted to do something different from others. Hence we started providing rankinngs for Indian Songs. BOTY Music became the first ever idea to Rank Indian Music based on their online popularity.
